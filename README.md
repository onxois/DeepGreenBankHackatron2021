# DeepGreenBankHackatron2021
Our hackatron 2021 implementation in Java & Eclipse
https://www.meetup.com/UKAzureUserGroup/events/274551171/

We created an index called "DeepGreenIndex", which represents the deforestation in Brazil on a daily base.

Our goal was to create a new underlying index for investment products.
